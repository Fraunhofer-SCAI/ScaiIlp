    // - All Visual C++ exceptions thrown from code generated by the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler contain this error code.
    // - The code is actually a cryptic mnemonic device, with the initial "E" standing for "exception" and the final 3 bytes (0x6D7363) representing the ASCII values of "msc".
